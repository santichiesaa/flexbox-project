          singer-songwriter. Most of Cash's music contained themes of sorrow,
          moral tribulation, and redemption, especially in the later stages of

        “I wore black because I liked it. I still do, and wearing it still means
        something to me. It's still my symbol of rebellion -- against a stagnant
        status quo, against our hypocritical houses of God, against people whose
        minds are closed to others' ideas.”
